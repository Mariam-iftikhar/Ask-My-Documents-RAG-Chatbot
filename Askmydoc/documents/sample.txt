Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique used in artificial intelligence
to improve the accuracy of large language models.

RAG works by combining two main steps: retrieval and generation.
In the retrieval step, the system searches external documents to find information
that is relevant to the user’s question.
In the generation step, the language model uses the retrieved information
to produce a final answer.

One major advantage of RAG is that it reduces hallucinations.
Hallucinations happen when an AI model makes up information that is not true.
By grounding responses in real documents, RAG helps ensure more reliable answers.

RAG systems often use vector databases.
Text documents are converted into numerical representations called embeddings.
These embeddings allow the system to perform semantic search,
which means it can find information based on meaning rather than exact keywords.

RAG is commonly used in applications such as document assistants,
customer support bots, internal company knowledge bases,
and research tools.

Although RAG systems are powerful, they must be designed carefully.
Large documents should be split into smaller chunks.
Only the most relevant chunks should be sent to the language model
to avoid exceeding token limits and to improve performance.
